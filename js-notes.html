            <li>
               <h3>Question: What is hoisting in JavaScript?</h3>
               <p>Answer: Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where function and variable declarations move to the top of their respective scope during the compilation phase.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: What is Closure in JavaScript?</h3>
               <p>Answer: A closure is the combination of a function bundled together with references to its surrounding state. In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: What are Promises in JavaScript?</h3>
               <p>Answer: Promises in JavaScript are like promises in real life. They represent actions that will finish in the future, either successfully or not. They help manage asynchronous tasks, like fetching data from a server, by providing a way to handle the outcome of these tasks once they're done. Promises have three states: pending (waiting for completion), fulfilled (successfully completed), and rejected (failed to complete). This makes it easier to write asynchronous code that is easier to read and understand.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: What are Callback Functions? What is their use?</h3>
               <p>Answer: Callback functions are functions passed as arguments to other functions, and they are executed after the completion of a specific task. They are commonly used in asynchronous operations, event handling, and more.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: What is the purpose of the “async” and “await” keywords in JavaScript?</h3>
               <p>Answer: The “async” keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function, which allows the use of the “await” keyword inside it. “await” is used to pause the execution of an async function until a Promise is resolved, simplifying asynchronous code and avoiding callback hell.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: What are Event Loop?</h3>
               <p>Answer: Event Loop: The event loop is a core mechanism in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations. It continuously checks the call stack and task queue, moving tasks from the queue to the stack when the stack is empty. This allows JavaScript to handle non-blocking I/O operations efficiently.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: What are this Keyword?</h3>
               <p>Answer: The “this” keyword refers to the object that owns the current code being executed. Its value is determined by how a function is called or how an object is constructed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: What is the difference between map() and forEach() array methods of an array?</h3>
               <p>Answer: The map() method is used when you want to modify each element of an array and create a new array with the modified values, forEach() method is used when you want to perform some operation on each element of an array without creating a new array.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: What is Modules?</h3>
               <p>Answer: Modules - Modules allow you to organize and encapsulate JavaScript code into reusable modules that can export and import functionality.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: What is JSON, and what does it consist of?</h3>
               <p>Answer: JSON is a lightweight data interchange format. It consists of key-value pairs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: What is the purpose of the “localStorage” and “sessionStorage” objects?</h3>
               <p>Answer: The “localStorage” and “sessionStorage” objects provide web developers with a way to store key-value pairs locally on a user’s browser. The “localStorage” data persists across sessions, while the “sessionStorage” data is cleared when the session ends.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: How do you handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript?</h3>
               <p>Answer: Asynchronous operations in JavaScript are typically handled using callbacks, promises, or the newer async/await syntax. Callbacks were the traditional approach, while promises and async/await provide more structured and readable code.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: What are the differences between JavaScript’s “null” and “undefined”?</h3>
               <p>Answer: “null” represents the deliberate absence of an object value, while “undefined” indicates an uninitialized variable or a variable that lacks a value. “null” is an assigned value, while “undefined” is a type in JavaScript.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: What is the purpose of the “apply” and “call” methods in JavaScript?</h3>
               <p>Answer: Both “apply” and “call” are used to invoke a function with a specified context (the value of “this”). The “apply” method accepts arguments as an array, while the “call” method accepts arguments individually.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: What is short-circuit evaluation in JavaScript?</h3>
               <p>Answer: Short-circuit evaluation stops the execution as soon as the result can be determined without evaluating the remaining sub-expressions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: What determines the type of a variable?</h3>
               <p>Answer: The data type determines the type of a variable.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: What is type coercion in JavaScript?</h3>
               <p>Answer: Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values between data types during operations or comparisons, such as string and number concatenation and the use of comparison operators.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: How is the spread operator (...) used in JavaScript?</h3>
               <p>Answer: The spread operator is used to expand or spread elements from an iterable (such as an array, string, or object) into individual elements. It is used for copying an array, merging arrays, and passing multiple arguments to a function.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: What is the rest operator used for in JavaScript?</h3>
               <p>Answer: The rest operator is used in function parameters to collect all remaining arguments into an array.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: What is the difference between named and anonymous functions? When to use what in applications?</h3>
               <p>Answer: Difference between Named and Anonymous Functions:<br>
                  Named Functions: Have a name, can be called before the function declaration.<br>
                  Anonymous Functions: Often used as expressions, defined at runtime, and can't be called before the declaration.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: What is a function expression in JS?</h3>
               <p>Answer: Function Expression in JavaScript:<br>
                  A function expression is a way to define a function within an expression rather than as a declaration. It can be named or anonymous.
               </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: What are Arrow Functions in JS? What is their use?</h3>
               <p>Answer: Arrow functions are a concise way to write anonymous functions. They have a shorter syntax and do not bind their own this value.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: What is a Higher-order function In JS?</h3>
               <p>Answer: A higher-order function is a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function as a result. They enable functional programming concepts like mapping, filtering, and reducing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: What is the difference between arguments and parameters?</h3>

            <li>
               <h3>Question: In how many ways can you pass arguments to a function?</h3>
               <p>Answer: Pass by Value: Primitive types are passed by value.<br>
                  Pass by Reference: Objects are passed by reference.<br>
                  Default Parameters: Assign default values to parameters.<br>
                  Rest Parameters: Gather remaining arguments into an array.
               </p>
            </li>

               <p>Answer: A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text. Template literals allow for embedding expressions or variables directly within strings, enhancing flexibility and readability.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: What is the Document Object Model (DOM)? How does it differ from HTML?</h3>
               <p>Answer: The DOM represents the webpage as a tree-like structure that allows JavaScript to dynamically access and manipulate the content and structure of a webpage, whereas HTML is a static markup language used to define the structure and content of a webpage.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: What are some important string operations in JavaScript?</h3>
               <p>Answer: String operations include length, toUpperCase(), toLowerCase(), charAt(index), concat(str), indexOf(substring), lastIndexOf(substring), substring(start, end), slice(start, end), among others.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: What is string immutability?</h3>
               <p>Answer: Strings in JavaScript are immutable, meaning you cannot change individual characters in a string directly. Operations like concatenation or modification create new strings.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: In how many ways can you concatenate strings?</h3>
               <p>Answer: Strings can be concatenated using the + operator, concat() method, template literals, or += shorthand.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3>Question: What is the difference between innerHTML and textContent ?</h3>
               <p>Answer: innerHTML is used to manipulate HTML content within an element, including nested HTML tags.<br>
                  textContent represents the plain text content of an element without interpreting any HTML tags.
               </p>
